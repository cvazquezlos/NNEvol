# NNEvol

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.com/cvazquezlos/NNEvol.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cvazquezlos/NNEvol)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of NNEvol is to solve one of the open problems in Machine and Deep Learning that is about "which does the best neural network architecture that fixes a given problem is?". NNEvol uses Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming for solving it. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of NNEvol from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("NNEvol")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cvazquezlos/NNEvol")
```
## Introduction

This library just has an unique function: **get_best_nn**. It receives some parameters:

* *data*. Is the element that individuals (neural networks) use in the evolution process. The received dataset will be a Dataframe whose inputs are displayed before the outputs, in any order.
* *input*. Number of inputs.
* *output*. Number of outputs.
* *train*. Proportion of the instances within the dataset that are used in the training process (default 0.70).
* *validation*. Proportion of the instances within the dataset that are used in the validation process (default 0.20).
* *test*. Proportion of the instances within the dataset that are used in the test process (default 0.10). This data is only used when train_final_nn is selected. In addition, the three above values (including this) would add 1.
* *train_mode*. Mode of the training process. 0 means multi-class, while 1 means regression. Binary classification could be expressed as a multi-class with n = 2 classes (default 0).
* *train_final_nn*. If the user wants NNEvol to train the final individual totally. If checked, this options allows you to know which are the metrics of the best neural network selected (default FALSE).
* *seed*. Seed that is used in the random processes of the package (default 123).
* *population_size*. Size of the population that participates in the evolution process (default 30). The bigger the number is, the longer the library takes to find a solution.
* *genetation_number*. Number of generations within the evolution process (default 30). The bigger the number is, the longer the library takes to find a solution.
